my segment is almassy and my spends are 2000 internationally abroad and 1000 locally in kuwait calculate my cashback? The cashback calculation for prepaid cards is 1% irrespective of the total amount of the transactions, so the cashback for your prepaid card would be the sum of the international and local spends --> (2000 + 1000) = (3000 * 1%) which is KD 30.
I am alsafwa and I spent kd 20000 for my prepaid card, calculate my cashback?
